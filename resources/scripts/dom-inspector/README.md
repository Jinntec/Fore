# [AcID DOM Inspector](http://janmyler.github.io/DOM-inspector/)

## Overview

**AcID DOM Inspector** (aka ADI) is a simple DOM inspector written in JavaScript. It has been created as a school project and doesn't aim to compete with tools such as Firebug or Chrome DevTools.

ADI provides a simple DOM tree overview with an interactive highlighting feature. Simple editing of attributes is available for selected DOM nodes.

## How to use

1.  [Download](https://github.com/janmyler/DOM-inspector/archive/master.zip) the latest version of ADI.
2.  Move the `acid-dom` folder into your project's root folder
3.  Add the ADI stylesheet to the `<head>` tag: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="acid-dom/css/acid_dom.css">`.
4.  Add the ADI source code before the `</body>` tag: `<script src="acid-dom/js/acid_dom.min.js"></script>`.
5.  That's it, now you're ready to start using ADI. ;)
