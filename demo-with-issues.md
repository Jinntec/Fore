# Broken or flaky demos:

## open
* subgraph.html
* kanban.html (check again)
* hello-json.html 
* reload.html
* actions.html
* if.html
* on-demand-repeat.html
* repeat-attributes.html
* group-relevance.html
* shared-instances.html (insert behavior when adding to child)
* repeat-attributes-3.html
* repeat-attributes-5.html
* repeat-attributes-8.html (delete not working)

## fixed 

### i18n2.html

fixed and tested
Resolution:
submission replace instance fires explicit hard refresh (see reset)

### reset.html
Resolution:

does hard refresh now but is justified here (might still have some potential considering the target instance of the reset)

### fx-replace.html

Resolution:
- does a hard refresh for now and remains an area of work
