## [Demos](https://jinntec.github.io/Fore)

This is the 'demo' branch which is used to publish
Fore demos to github pages.

***It shouldn't be used as source of development!***

If you want to work with latest Fore code please use the
'dev' branch.


## Giant shoulders

The giants that made Fore possible:

* past and current [XForms editors](https://www.w3.org/community/xformsusers/wiki/XForms_2.0) - not all brilliant ideas get traction and fame. Nevertheless a brilliantly worked out state engine.
* [fontoXPath](https://github.com/FontoXML/fontoxpath) - without this wonderful XPath 3.1 implementation in the browser Fore has never been possible - period.
* [depGraph](https://github.com/jriecken/dependency-graph) - finding this gem saved a big bunch of work. 

Thanks to all giants!
