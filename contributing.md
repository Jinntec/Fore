## What to contribute

### Demos + Docs

"demo or die" - Fore is open with regard to the functionality. It's expected to grow over time and new ideas getting
added on the way that haven't been planned ahead of time. 

Demos illustrate what's working and also explain the different options of a feature. New demos should follow the the structure
and styling of the existing files in the 'demo' directory.

### Code

Code contributions are accepted as pull requests to the default branch (dev). 

Before sending a PR you should:
* add tests as appropriate for new features and make sure they run green
* run the tests with `npm run test`
* run the linter with `npm run lint:eslint`
* there's no harm to also run 'npm run format:prettier` 

### Tests

Testers highly welcome. There's myriad of possibilities to break the code. Help to fix the loose ends.

### Bug reports

Add the following to a bug report:

* describe your use case shortly
* what do you expect?
* what do you get?

Don't forget to add information about your browser version and OS.
