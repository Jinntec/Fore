        <!--
        submission is a complex beast in XForms and has many options. However we should concentrate on the most
        important features.

        Submissions use the URI context they are loaded from. For eXist-db this context is that of an app that holds
        the form we're processing. A submission must support either relative (relative to the form document or absolute
        addressing.

        E.g. assuming this form was loaded from /db/apps/my-app/my-form.html our base URI would be '/db/apps/my-app'.
        Whatever we put in the 'resource' attribute would resolve to that.

        Absolute addressing would look like this: resource='/db/apps/another-app/data'.

        Notice that there's no protocol mentioned. I assume that submitted data in the majority of cases will simply be
        stored in the database somewhere or call an xquery for further processing. This should pretty much cover
        our use cases though additional protocols like 'http://' might be added later for convenience.
        -->


        <!--
        'resource' is the target where to send the submitted data. AVTs ({}) should be supported as part of the
        resource value.

        'replace' may have these values:
        - 'none' do nothing with the response of the 'resource' endpoint
        - 'instance' replace the default instance with the data returned by 'resource' (to target another instance there
          might be the optional 'instance' attribute which is an idref to that instance.
        - 'all' replace the whole form (ending the form session) with whatever the submission returns (not sure if we
        need that in our context as we can achieve that in a different way)
        -->

        <!--
        There are certainly more features of submissions that we'll want in the future. This means that the
        implementation must be maintainable and flexible for extensions.
