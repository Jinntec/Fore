# Undo/redo for Fore instance data — summary

Status: implemented and hardened, **not yet committed**. Covered by 37 dedicated unit tests
in `test/undo-redo.test.js` (966 total in the project's full suite) and 7 Cypress e2e tests
(`cypress/e2e/undo-redo.cy.js`) against `demo/undo-redo.html`.

## What it does

Every action chain (`fx-setvalue`, `fx-insert`, `fx-delete`, `fx-reset`, `fx-replace`,
instance-replacing `fx-send`, `fx-upload`, drag-and-drop reordering) and every direct widget
edit through `fx-control` can be undone and redone.

Coalescing is deliberately split by the nature of the edit, not by a single time window:
- **Action chains never coalesce.** Clicking the same button (or a counter's "+1") three
  times fast produces three undo steps, not one - each chain is already a complete,
  deliberate operation.
- **Widget-driven typing coalesces while the widget stays focused**, closing on blur (or on
  the explicit `<fx-commit-history>` action - see below). Bounded by focus, not by a fixed
  delay, so it behaves the same whether typing takes one second or one minute.

(An earlier version of this feature coalesced everything - actions included - within a
1-second window of the same node. That conflated "the user is still typing" with "the user
clicked the same button again quickly," which silently merged repeated button clicks into
one undo step. Replaced with the focus/action split above before anything shipped.)

Opt-in and zero-cost when unused:

```html
<fx-model undo undo-depth="50">
```

- `undo` — master switch. Off by default; without it `UndoManager` never clones anything.
- `undo-depth` — max stack size (default 50). Only takes effect combined with `undo`.

New action elements:

```html
<fx-trigger><button>undo</button><fx-undo></fx-undo></fx-trigger>
<fx-trigger><button>redo</button><fx-redo></fx-redo></fx-trigger>
```

fire `undo-done` / `redo-done` with `{canUndo, canRedo}` in the detail.

A third action forces a coalescing boundary on demand, without requiring blur - useful for a
textarea where an author wants a checkpoint mid-edit (e.g. on Enter, or a "save draft"
button):

```html
<fx-trigger><button>checkpoint</button><fx-commit-history></fx-commit-history></fx-trigger>
```

It never creates an undo step of its own - it only closes whatever widget-edit session is
currently open, so the next edit (even to the same still-focused field) starts a new step.

Optional keyboard shortcuts, opt-in per `<fx-fore>` (overrides native text-field undo, hence
opt-in):

```html
<fx-fore keyboard-shortcuts>
```

Ctrl/Cmd+Z → undo, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z or Ctrl/Cmd+Y → redo.

## How it works

- **`src/UndoManager.js`** — one instance per `FxModel` (`model.undoManager`). Snapshot-based
  (memento pattern, not a command/operation log — see "Design choice" below): `beginCapture()`
  clones every instance in the model (`cloneNode(true)` for XML, `structuredClone()` for JSON)
  before a chain runs. Two ways to turn that snapshot into an undo step:
  - `commit(touchedNode)` — always pushes a new, distinct entry. Used by every action-driven
    path (`AbstractAction`'s generic hook, `fx-upload`, drag-and-drop).
  - `commitCoalesced(sessionKey)` — merges into the currently open session if `sessionKey`
    matches it, otherwise opens a new one. Used only by `fx-control.js`'s direct widget edits,
    and only when the widget is genuinely focused (`document.activeElement`) - a fully
    programmatic call never opens a session, so it can't be left dangling for something
    unrelated to merge into later.
  - `endCoalescingSession()` closes the open session - called from `fx-control`'s `blur`
    listener and from `<fx-commit-history>`. `commit()` also closes it defensively, so an
    action firing while a field is still focused (no blur) can't let that field's next edit
    wrongly merge across the action.
  - Chains that end without a mutation are discarded via `discard()`.
- **Chain boundary**: hooked into `AbstractAction.execute()` / `_finalizePerform()`
  (`src/actions/abstract-action.js`) at the exact point where `FxFore.outermostHandler` is
  acquired/released — nested/sequenced actions within one synchronous chain already share this
  boundary, so one undo step per user-visible operation falls out for free.
- **`FxModel.getEffectiveUndoManager()`** — a model with zero `<fx-instance>` of its own (a
  nested `fx-fore` that only consumes an ancestor's `shared` instance) delegates to the nearest
  ancestor that actually owns instances, so its undo/redo correctly operates on the shared data
  instead of silently recording empty snapshots.

## Hardening pass (this session)

The initial implementation passed its own tests but hadn't been stress-tested against edge
cases. A self-assessment turned up concrete gaps, all now closed or explicitly documented:

| # | Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Reentrancy: a rapid double-click on the same (singleton, reused) action element could permanently strand `FxFore.outermostHandler` and silently drop an undo commit — a pre-existing framework hazard that undo's correctness now depended on. | Outermost-acquisition state moved from a shared instance property to a local variable threaded through `execute()`/`_finalizePerform()`. Added a `_busy` guard on `fx-undo`/`fx-redo` as defense in depth. |
| 2 | `fx-send`'s instance-replacing submissions never set `needsUpdate` (deliberately, to avoid a double refresh) — the generic hook saw no change and discarded every such edit. | Set `needsUpdate = true` and added an `actionPerformed()` override that skips the now-redundant default cycle, matching the `fx-reset` pattern. |
| 3 | `fx-upload` and drag-and-drop reordering (`withDraggability._drop()`) bypass `AbstractAction` entirely — the generic hooks never fired for them. | Added explicit `beginCapture()`/`commit()` around each. The `fx-droptarget` branch (pure light-DOM element reordering, no instance data involved) is correctly left unwrapped. |
| 4 | A model that owns *some* instances of its own but also mutates an unrelated `shared` instance elsewhere (the "mixed" case) isn't covered by `getEffectiveUndoManager()` — edits to the outside instance are silently un-tracked. | Scoped decision: diagnostic only. `UndoManager` logs a one-time `console.warn` instead of silently mis-tracking. Full fix (keying undo history by instance instead of by model) documented as a deferred follow-up. |
| 5 | No test coverage for JSON-type instances (`type="json"`) — every original test used XML. | Added setvalue undo/redo, coalescing, and mixed XML+JSON-in-one-model tests. |
| 6 | No coverage of long undo/redo sequences or repeated undo→mutate→redo cycling. | Added a 20-step stress test with start/middle/end checkpoints, and a 5-cycle test confirming redo-stack invalidation holds under repetition, not just once. |
| 7 | No test of undo/redo crossing a validation (valid/invalid) boundary. | Added a test asserting `ModelItem.constraint` and the `valid`/`invalid` events/attribute update correctly across an undo that restores a previously-valid value. |
| 8 | Clone-cost-at-scale was an assumption, not a measurement. | Benchmarked (see below) — no cause for concern at realistic sizes. |

## Performance (measured, Chrome)

`UndoManager.beginCapture()` + `commit()`, per undo step:

| Document size | XML | JSON |
|---|---|---|
| 500 elements/items | ~0.3 ms | ~0.4 ms |
| 2,000 | ~1.1 ms | ~1.4 ms |
| 5,000 | ~3.4 ms | ~4.4 ms |

Scales linearly, no cliff. Even a 5,000-element document — a genuinely large form — stays
under 4 ms per step. No optimization needed at realistic Fore document sizes.

## Design choice: snapshot, not a command/operation log

Considered and rejected (for now) an alternative design: recording each mutation as an
invertible operation (à la ProseMirror) instead of cloning whole documents. Rejected because:

- The snapshot approach is correct *by construction* — restoring a serialized state can't be
  subtly wrong. An operation log is only as correct as every action type's hand-written inverse
  (insert/delete need stable node identity across index shifts, replace needs to store what was
  replaced, etc.) — a much larger surface for silent corruption bugs.
- It wouldn't actually save the expensive part: `recalculate()`/`revalidate()` still has to run
  after applying an inverse operation regardless of how the raw data change was represented.
- The measured clone cost (above) doesn't justify the added risk and engineering cost.

If a future app's usage pattern genuinely needs cheaper per-step undo, the cheaper intermediate
step is snapshotting only the instance(s) an edit's coalesce-key node actually belongs to,
rather than always cloning every instance in the model — a small change to
`UndoManager._snapshot()`, not a rewrite.

## Known limitations (documented, not fixed)

Full detail in `doc/shared-instance-refresh-investigation.md`:

- **Mixed shared+local instances** (hardening item 4 above): diagnostic warning only, not a
  full fix.
- **`FxFore.outermostHandler` is a page-global static**: two independent `<fx-fore>` forms with
  genuinely overlapping async action chains (via `delay`/`while`) can still cause one to miss a
  capture. Rare in practice; documented as a residual framework-level limitation.
- **Pre-existing, unrelated bug found while testing drag-drop**: `withDraggability._drop()`'s
  reorder logic compares DOM `previousSibling` directly against the dragged node; whitespace
  text nodes between XML elements (e.g. from indented markup) break that comparison and
  silently no-op the reorder. Not caused by, or specific to, undo/redo.
- **Rapid *programmatic* edits immediately after undo/redo**: `fx-undo`/`fx-redo` trigger a
  fire-and-forget `refresh(true)`; a script that calls `setValue()` again before that refresh
  settles can see `isRefreshing === true` and skip capture for that edit. Not reachable at
  human click/typing speed — only matters for automated/scripted interaction.
- **A nested `fx-fore` with no `<fx-instance>` of its own** doesn't reliably refresh its own UI
  after a *partial*-cycle action targeting a shared instance (the underlying data and the
  undo/redo mechanism are both correct; only the display can lag until the next full refresh —
  which is exactly what `fx-undo`/`fx-redo` themselves force, so undo/redo through the buttons
  is unaffected). Root-caused but not fixed; see the investigation doc for the exact mechanism
  and suggested next steps.
